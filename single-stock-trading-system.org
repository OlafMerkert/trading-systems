* TODO Introduction
We wish to develop a basic trading system, which can watch a single stock and keep track of a single position an said stock.

Our language of choice is Common Lisp, we start by loading the required dependencies.
#+begin_src lisp
(ql:quickload '(ol-utils drakma cl-csv parse-number eazy-gnuplot))
#+end_src

* DONE Importing data
We begin by downloading the CSV data and parsing it. Notice that months are given first and use numbers 0-11. For days, the usual numbering 1-31 is used.
#+begin_src lisp
(defpar *stock-csv-data*
        (cl-csv:read-csv
         (drakma:http-request "http://chart.finance.yahoo.com/table.csv?s=SPY&a=0&b=1&c=2000&d=11&e=31&f=2010&g=d&ignore=.csv"
                              :want-stream t :close t)))

The data is still of type string. We have 7 columns, but we only need Open, High, Low, Close and Volume.

We define a new class to hold this data. We keep each column in a separate array/vector.

(defpar *current-stock* (csv->stock "SPY" *stock-csv-data*))
#+end_src
For now, we ignore the concrete dates and just use integers to refer to dates. Note that higher index means earlier date.
** DONE Subclass for filtering to past data
For our trading algorithm, we need to restrict our view to the past. Sometimes it may be useful to generally restrict to some time interval.
#+begin_src lisp
(defclass/f stock-subseq (stock)
  (parent start end))

(defun stock-subseq (stock start &optional end)
  ;; if end is larger than sequence length, just go to sequence end
  (let1 (len (length (stock-date stock)))
    (unless (or (not end) (<= end len))
      (setf end len)))
  (make-instance 'stock-subseq :parent stock :start start :end end))

(defmethod stock-ticker ((stock-subseq stock-subseq))
  (stock-ticker (parent stock-subseq)))

;; bind multi copies the definition for stock-date for the other slots
(bind-multi ((stock-date stock-date stock-open stock-high stock-low stock-close stock-volume))
  (defmethod stock-date ((stock-subseq stock-subseq))
    (subseq (stock-date (parent stock-subseq)) (start stock-subseq) (end stock-subseq))))
#+end_src

* DONE Trading system
We need to implement orders. For now we restrict to the single stock case.

+ An order is long or short, on some specific stock
+ The order starts at open, and finishes at close
+ for each we have a starting day
+ starting and finishing both return a number: positive if adding to your account (selling), negative if deducting (buying). Transaction cost is factored in automatically.
+ Before committing to an order, we need to check we have the money.
** DONE Orders
The lifecycle of an order is as follows:
+ Decide on the stock and whether to long or short it
+ Then try to open the order, see if we can afford it. Possibly decrease the volume.
+ Finally close the order. For short orders, we also need to check if we actually can afford it.
#+begin_src lisp
(defclass/f order ()
  (order-stock order-type order-start order-end order-volume))

(defun order-create (stock &optional (order-type :long))
  (make-instance 'order
                 :order-stock stock :order-type order-type
                 :order-start nil :order-end nil :order-volume nil))

(defmethod print-object ((object order) stream)
  (print-unreadable-object (object stream :type t)
    (with-slots (order-type order-end order-start order-volume)
        object
      (if order-end
          (format stream "~A Duration: ~A Volume: ~A" order-type (- order-start order-end) order-volume)
          (format stream "~A Start: ~A Volume: ~A" order-type order-start order-volume))))
  object)

(defmethod order-duration ((order order))
  (with-slots (order-start order-end) order
    (if order-end
        (abs (- order-start order-end))
        0)))
#+end_src

For the dates we just use integers, referring to indices for the =stock= datastructure. We store the date in a special variable. Both =order-open= and =order-close= return a number which represents the balance change of our account. This includes already the transaction costs (which depend on =order-volume= and current stock value).

Note we always open orders at "open", and always close orders at "close".

Currently slippage is not modeled, I am not even sure it would factor into this code.
#+begin_src lisp
(defvar *current-date* 0)
(defpar *transaction-cost-factor* 0.0025)

(defmethod order-open ((order order) volume)
  ;; check if volume is available for long
  (when (and (eql (order-type order) :long)
             (< (aref (stock-volume (order-stock order)) *current-date*) volume))
    ;; todo signal something
    (return-from order-open nil))
  (setf (order-start order) *current-date*
        (order-volume order) volume)
  ;; buy/sell at opening time
  (let ((amount (* (if (eql (order-type order) :long) -1 1)
                   volume (aref (stock-open (order-stock order)) *current-date*))))
    ;; pay transaction fee
    (- amount (* *transaction-cost-factor* amount))))

(defmethod order-close ((order order))
  ;; check if volume is available for short
  (when (and (not (eql (order-type order) :long))
             (< (aref (stock-volume (order-stock order)) *current-date*) (order-volume order)))
    ;; todo signal something
    (return-from order-close nil))
  (setf (order-end order) *current-date*)
  ;; buy/sell at closing time
  (let ((amount (* (if (eql (order-type order) :long) 1 -1)
                   (order-volume order) (aref (stock-close (order-stock order)) *current-date*))))
    ;; pay transaction fee
    (- amount (* *transaction-cost-factor* amount))))
#+end_src

We add a function that determines the maximal volume available to buy for a given amount of money. For each piece of stock we need to spend market price and transaction fee. We assume we cannot buy part of a stock, so volume should always be an integer.
#+begin_src lisp
(defmethod stock-available-volume ((stock stock) time amount)
  (min (aref (stock-volume stock) *current-date*)
       (floor amount
              (* (aref (if (eql time :open) (stock-open stock) (stock-close stock)) *current-date*)
                 (+ 1 *transaction-cost-factor*)))))

(defmethod stock-available-volume ((stock stock) (order order) amount)
  (assert (eql stock (order-stock order)))
  (stock-available-volume stock (if (eql (order-type order) :long) :open :close) amount))
#+end_src

** DONE Trading
For actual trading, we need to keep track of
+ current order
+ current balance
and maybe also collect some statistics. We model this with a trader object. A trader can only have one position at a time. We assume the trader is not completely stupid, so he will avoid always negative balance -- until time is over, and he may be forced to close a shorted position.

** DONE Reporting for trading
One important feature is still missing from the =trader= class: keeping track of which orders went through and how the balance evolved over time. To implement this, we hook into balance changes and watch for successfully concluded orders.

#+end_src

If we do not trade every day, then there will be gaps in the =balance-report= vector. We need to fill these up, by copying the balance from the previous day. For convenience, we immediately return the vector.

The order list should not require any further fixup.

We now want to simulate the trader on the market. A trader is defined by subclassing =trader= and implementing the =trade= method (which should take no further arguments). The simulation can also be started at a later time.

* TODO Basic trading algorithm
The idea for my trading algorithm is to do something a little bit more complicated thing than a moving average: Trying to fit a parabola to some moving frame of data. This should give some information also on the curvature, and maybe we can even predict or at least anticipate extrema.
** TODO Fitting quadratic functions
The standard method for fitting a polynomial to some data is using Least-Squares. It seems what we need is available in [[https://github.com/blindglobe/lisp-matrix/tree/master][lisp-matrix]], namely a QR decomposition.

Let's start by doing something not too complicated, which does require any complicated libraries.

We look at a moving interval in the past, look at the average in the first and second half and compare those. Then we flip a weighted coin to make a decision. 


#+begin_src lisp
(defpar *random-trader-confidence* 5/7) ; magic prime numbers :-P

(defun flip-coin ()
  (<= (random 1.0) *random-trader-confidence*))

(defun average (vector)
  (/ (reduce #'+ vector) (length vector)))

(defun argmax (seq)
  (let ((m (maximise seq)))
    (position m seq :test #'<=)))

(defun bins-average (vector &optional (bin-count 2))
  "Split vector into `bin-count' equally large sequences and a list of averages."
  (assert (<= 2 bin-count))
  (let* ((bin-length (ceiling (length vector) bin-count))
         (bins (iter (for i from 0 below bin-count)
                     (collect (subseq vector (* i bin-length) (* (+ i 1) bin-length))))))
     (mapcar #'average bins)))
#+end_src

Note that in case of equal averages, the first bin is going to be preferred.

The =trade= method will be called every day (before open) and has to make a decision whether to short, long or conclude. For now, we only to long trades. When we do investments, we try to be more careful when we actually observed a downward trend.

*** Observations
+ =observation-frame-length= seems to be quite important. Low numbers like 40 even make us lose money big time.
+ Also, it seems that when we detect higher changes, we should invest less. Probably because these changes go in both directions.
+ However, it does not seem to work if we start to reverse the type of order for higher changes.
